What’s Happening in PII

Ocean Animals +
Valentine’s Day
Central Idea: Children explore ocean animals
and their habitats.
Guiding Questions:

protect themselves?

animals and keep the ocean clean?

waves, reef, coral, tide, swim, float, fin,
pollution, prey, predator, recycle
Student Outcomes:
●​ Students will identify ocean animals and
recognize their individual characteristics.
●​ Students will learn the various habitats of
ocean animals, learn what they eat, and
how they protect themselves.
●​ Students will demonstrate one simple
action to care for the ocean.

It’s been an exciting week leading up
to Valentine’s Day! We made
valentines for our family and friends,
created colorful marble-rolling heart
art to brighten our classroom, and
decorated our Valentine’s bags.
Everyone is excited to exchange
valentines tomorrow before the
party! It’s been great seeing the
children write so much in the
classroom, and their progress is
becoming more noticeable each
week. We sang Valentine’s songs,
played math games, and played
letter-sound BINGO.
Next week, we will resume our focus
on ocean animals, continue our
handwriting workbooks, and resume
Storytelling.

Primary II students will reflect joy and
engagement in a group music-making
activity. Students will also do instrument
stations.

We have been celebrating Black History
Month in the library, and next week,
Primary students will listen to Dream Big,
Little One by Vashti Harrison and Black is a
Rainbow Color by Angela Joy. These books
have joyful and inspiring messages that I
look forward to sharing!

Primary II students will learn the names of
farm animals and some of the sounds they
make.

Home Connection: Read with your child each night. Brainstorm what they know about ocean animals and what they

are curious to learn. Talk about ways to take care of the ocean and the planet. Practice patterns and writing numbers 1-10
in fun ways at home.
