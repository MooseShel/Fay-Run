📣 PARENT INFORMATION SECTION
Dear Families,
Your child is preparing for the Unit 5 Geometry & Measurement assessment. This unit focuses
on:
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​

Identifying, measuring, and classifying angles
Using a protractor
Understanding angles as turns
Identifying parallel and perpendicular lines
Classifying polygons and identifying line symmetry
Finding the area and perimeter of rectangles
Solving problems involving composite shapes

How to Support at Home
●​
●​
●​
●​

Ask your child to explain the difference between area and perimeter.
Have them identify angles around the house.
Let them measure angles using a protractor.
Practice multiplication facts (important for area).

Students should:
●​ Use their red math notebook.
●​ Review listed workbook pages.
●​ Ask questions if something is unclear.
Thank you for your support!

📘 UNIT 5 REFERENCE SHEET
🔷 ANGLES
What You Need to Know
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​

Acute < 90°
Right = 90°
Obtuse > 90° and < 180°
Straight = 180°
Angles are measured in degrees (°).
Angles can be added together.
Angles represent turns or rotations.
