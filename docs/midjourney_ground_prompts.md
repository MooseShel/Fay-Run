## Midjourney Parameters Explained

- **`--ar 16:3`**: Wide aspect ratio perfect for a horizontal ground strip
- **`--style raw`**: Less stylized, more controlled output
- **`--v 6`**: Uses Midjourney version 6 for best quality
- **`--tile`**: Add this if you need perfectly seamless tiling (optional)
- **`--niji 6`**: Use instead of `--v 6` for more anime/cartoon style
- **`--c 20`**: Reduces color variation for more consistent output

## Key Prompt Elements

- **"seamless tileable"**: Ensures the texture can repeat horizontally without visible seams
- **"clean top edge"**: Important for where the character runs on the surface
- **"side view perspective"**: Ensures proper 2D runner game angle
- **"flat 2D game asset"**: Prevents 3D depth that wouldn't work for the game
- **"no depth"**: Keeps the texture flat for consistent gameplay

## Usage Tips

1. Copy the desired prompt into Midjourney
2. Generate 4 variations and pick the best one
3. If edges aren't seamless, try adding `--tile` parameter
4. Upscale your favorite version
5. Test in-game to ensure it tiles properly
6. Adjust colors in post-processing if needed

## Image Specifications

- **Recommended Resolution**: 2048x384 pixels (after upscale)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency (if needed)
- **Color Mode**: RGB
- **Tiling**: Horizontal only (left-right seamless)
